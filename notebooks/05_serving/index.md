# Serving and scaling

```{admonition} What you'll learn in this part
:class: tip

- KV-cache variants (MHA → GQA → MLA) and when each is worth the
  quality tradeoff.
- KV compression (StreamingLLM, H2O, SnapKV) and 2-bit KV
  quantisation (KIVI).
- Weight quantisation: GPTQ + AWQ; SmoothQuant rescaling; FP8 and
  NF4 numeric formats; QuaRot / SpinQuant rotations.
- Batching strategies side by side (static / dynamic / continuous /
  chunked-prefill).
- Mixture-of-experts routing, capacity factors, and load-balance
  loss.
- DistServe-style goodput-optimised disaggregation and
  Prometheus-shaped observability + SLO-driven autoscaling.
```


## Key terms used in this part

- **{term}`MHA`**, **{term}`GQA`**, and **{term}`MLA`** are attention
  variants with different KV-cache memory footprints.
- **{term}`KV quantization`** and **{term}`KV eviction`** reduce KV memory
  using different tradeoffs (numeric precision vs token retention).
- **{term}`continuous batching`** and **{term}`chunked prefill`** are
  scheduler patterns for higher goodput under mixed workloads.
- **{term}`MoE`** and **{term}`expert parallel`** describe sparse expert routing at scale.
- **{term}`SLO`** is the service reliability target that autoscaling is designed to satisfy.
